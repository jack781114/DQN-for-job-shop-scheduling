# DQN-for-job-shop-scheduling
This project uses Deep Q-Network(DQN) for job shop scheduling in Reinforcement learning, and the information is taken from the public data platform - http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/orlib/files/jobshop1.txt.

In industrial manufacturing, production scheduling is a task of significant importance. As mentioned in referenced articles, contemporary demands on such tasks, like job shop scheduling, require systems capable of accommodating various variables in production needs. These variables include production requirements, processing times, and available machines. Obtaining efficient scheduling results in a short time frame for large-scale job shop scheduling presents a considerable challenge.
